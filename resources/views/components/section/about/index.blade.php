            KHALQ Foundation Pakistan is a student-led non-profit organization dedicated to serve society. We were founded in 2020 by a group of passionate and driven students who wanted to make a difference in their community.

            Since then, we have grown and expanded our reach, but our mission remains the same: to serve the society. We believe that every person has the power to create positive change, and we are committed to using our skills and resources to help those in need.

            Our team is made up of dedicated volunteers from different educational institutes who are committed to making a difference. We rely on the support of our community to carry out our mission, and we are grateful for every person who joins us in the fight to work for society.
